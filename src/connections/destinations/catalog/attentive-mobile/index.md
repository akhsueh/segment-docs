## Supported methods

The Attentive Mobile destination supports the following methods, as specified in the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec).

### Identify

Send [Identify](/docs/connections/spec/identify) calls to add attributes to the Attentive subscriber. These attributes are used to target Attentive subscribers in the [Attentive Segments product](https://help.attentivemobile.com/hc/en-us/categories/360004558392-Subscriber-segments){:target="_blank"}. For example:

```js
analytics.identify("userId123", {
  phone: "+13334445555",
  favoriteColor: "red",
});
```

Segment sends Identify calls to Attentive Mobile as an `identify` event. The event's `traits` are saved to the Attentive subscriber with phone `+13334445555`.

It may take up to 10 minutes for the `identify` attributes to appear in Attentive.

> info ""
> For best results, send at least one Identify call that contains both a Segment `userId` and `email` or `phone`. This enables Attentive Mobile to link the Segment `userId` with an Attentive Mobile subscriber.

### Track

Send [Track](/docs/connections/spec/track) calls to save the event to the Attentive subscriber as an Attentive "Custom Event". These events are used to target Attentive subscribers. For example:

```js
analytics.track("Login Button Clicked");
```

Segment sends Track calls to Attentive Mobile as a `track` event. The event is saved to the Attentive subscriber, and is usable in both the [Attentive Segments product](https://help.attentivemobile.com/hc/en-us/categories/360004558392-Subscriber-segments){:target="_blank"} and the [Attentive Journeys product](https://help.attentivemobile.com/hc/en-us/categories/6084285157396){:target="_blank"}.

It may take up to 10 minutes for the track events to appear in Attentive.
