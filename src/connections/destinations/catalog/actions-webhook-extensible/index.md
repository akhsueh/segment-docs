Segment's Extensible Webhooks destination lets you send custom data payloads to any webhook endpoint. With support for flexible payload configuration, multiple authentication methods, and real-time data flow, Extensible Webhooks can help you integrate with internal systems or tools not covered by Segment’s standard destinations.

Segment maintains this destination. For any issues, [contact Segment Support](friends@segment.com).
